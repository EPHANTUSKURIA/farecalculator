/*At the start of the year 2023 the cost of oil in the international market is predicted to increase to
close and as a result, the cost of travel fare for different modes of transport will be revised as
follows:
Bus fare 12% increase for distance over 151km AND Taxi 15% increase for distance over
1500km.
Write a program in C language that will allow user to check the current transport fare for both
bus and tax. It should provide user with a menu for selecting either Bus or Taxi then prompt the
user to enter distance he/she wishes to travel. The program should calculate and output the new
revised travel fare for the journey from the old fare shown in the table. Use both switch and
if..elseif decision structures.
